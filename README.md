___*This is also one of my testing project and / or draft___


## How do I have this idea?
Just because the .dll files in Windows system. 
One day, someone said that create .dll is a hard thing (forgot who said that),
and then there is a sudden idea, "Why don't i make an application that makes simpler data files?"

So that's why this thing was born.

## How to use
It will generate data of properties and value in file with plain text extension (.txt)
Also, there is a preview function for preview last file or any files you want.

You can use it to replace Dynamic Link Library (.dll) temporarily. 

## How to read
For example, this is the test file:
```
a = 12
b = 23
```

You can read  by using these command below:

- ```text.split("C:\text.txt") 'Use string split```
- ```Dim sw as StreamReader 'Use string split in StreamWriter```
- Et cetera.

The result may display as:
```
The value of a is 12
The value of b is 23
```

## Please Mind that...
This application project is not stable.
This project may update irregularly.
